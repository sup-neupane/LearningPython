    "Types of supervised learning problems are :  \n",
    "Classification: Predict if sth is one or the other it can be binary or multi class(more than two catagories) e.g. Does this person have a heart disease or not   \n",
    "Regression: It is trying to predict a number e.g. for how much will this house sell for  \n",

    "2. Unsupeervised Learning:\n",
    "Here you dont have labels. Here you the programmer groups (clusters) the data together.Unlike supervised learning, where the model is provided with input-output pairs, unsupervised learning deals with input data only and tries to make sense of it without predefined categories or labels.  \n",

    "3. Transfer Learning:  \n",
    "Transfer learning is a machine learning technique where a model developed for a particular task is reused as the starting point for a model on a second task. It leverages the knowledge gained from one domain (where data is abundant) and applies it to a different, but related, domain (where data may be scarce).  \n",

The agent learns by receiving rewards or penalties based on the actions it takes, aiming to maximize the cumulative reward over time.  \n",
